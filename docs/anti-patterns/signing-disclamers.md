# Signing disclaimers

One very effective way to **deter** people from using your software is to
request them to sign different disclaimers, a few examples being listed below:

- [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin)
- [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement)

While it is a very good idea to document the conditions under which you are
accepting contributions, preventing people from creating a pull request or from
testing it before they sign such a document is a very bad idea.

As far as I know, there is no single legal case where the presence of such a
document had any effect on the outcome of a lawsuit. You would be adding a wall
that does not add any protection, but it does for sure add more friction.
