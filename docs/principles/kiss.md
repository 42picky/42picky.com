# KISS Principle

[KISS principle][1] is one of the most important principles that can be
applied in software development. It stands for *Keep It Simple, Stupid.* and
it means that the software should be kept as simple as possible.

As a software developer, you should aim to always avoid adding complexity,
or over-engineering.

Historical figures had their own versions of expressing mainly the same
ideas:

*Leonardo da Vinci*

:   Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication

*Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry*

:   It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away
