# KISS Principle

[KISS principle][1] is one of the most important principles that can be
applied in software development. It stands for _Keep It Simple, Stupid._ and
it means that the software should be kept as simple as possible.

As a software developer, you should aim to always avoid adding complexity,
or over-engineering.

Historical figures had their own versions of expressing mainly the same
ideas:

_Leonardo da Vinci_

: Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication

_Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry_

: It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away
